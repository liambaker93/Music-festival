## User Stories

I don't go to many festivals but particularly want to see one artist and want the flexibility
to go just to see them.

I'm a regular festival goer and want to see the variety of artists I can watch, different
timings, and see what food options there are for me. 

I'm a food vendor and want to be able to sign up to bring  my business to the festival, so will
need a way to contact the organisers.
