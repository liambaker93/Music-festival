# Through The Trees - Music Festival 

Welcome to the README for the Through The Trees music festival website.

Visit the deployed site: [Through The Trees](https://liambaker93.github.io/Music-festival/index.html)

I wanted to create a site that could showcase similar kinds of content in different ways showcase what I've learnt so far regarding using HTML and CSS together to code a responsive, visually appealing website.

## Rationale



## User Stories

I don't go to many festivals but particularly want to see one artist and want the flexibility
to go just to see them.

I'm a regular festival goer and want to see the variety of artists I can watch, different
timings, and see what food options there are for me. 

I'm a food vendor and want to be able to sign up to bring  my business to the festival, so will
need a way to contact the organisers.

## Wireframes

### Desktop Wireframes

Going into the wireframing process, I had quite a good idea already of how I wanted the pages to look. 

I knew that I wanted the main call to action button to be the book now button which would remain consistent throughout all the pages.

Specifically with the homepage I wanted to have a carousel of images that would show off the vibe of the festival, with a text box next to it giving a brief description for the user to understand a little about the festival itself. If the description sounded appealing then the aim is for the user to be guided to the Artists page to see who's playing...

With the Artists page, I wanted to use cards to showcase the two main headlining acts, one for Saturday and one for Sunday, and then have a row of cards beneath to show other artists performing. This would give the user the chance to see if anyone they know is performing which would then push them to want to book their tickets to come to the festival.

The Food page was a page I wanted to add to help round out the idea that this was a festival with more to it than just music, and had some actual thought put into it. In terms of layout design, I wanted it to resemble the artists page closely, however I didn't want to give the impression of 'headliner' food options, so opted to have all the cards be the same size and layout.

The final page is the main booking page. On this page I wanted to give the user the option of which dates they wanted to attend as well as the number of tickets they want to order. To make the page more engaging, I planned on putting a carousel of images behind the booking form to liven the page up.

### Phone Wireframes

The phone designs were designed to just be smaller versions of the main pages, taking away some content where it wouldn't make sense to have on a smaller screen, for example the carousel of images behind the booking form on the booking page.

## Styling

### Fonts

The first font I found on google fonts was 'Almendra'.

Almendra is the font I've used for all headings in elements.

<img src="../>

The next font I found which became the 'secondary-font' variable was 'Raleway'.

## Testing

### Code Validation

One of the common info boxes I had show up during the validation process was 'trailing slashes on void elements'. Self closing elements had slashes ahead of the closing tags which the validator flagged as being unneeded so I went through the code on all the pages to eliminate these. 

<img src="../music-festival/readme/images/testing/html-validation.PNG" alt="Screenshot of web page showing validated HTML" width="250">

One warning that was suggested by the validator was having a section which had no heading underneath it. The following is the validator comment, and below is the content displayed on the site:

<img src="../music-festival/readme/images/testing/index-booking-validation-content.PNG" alt="Screenshot of a web page with a booking form with no title" width="250">

I then added a H5 element above the table in the modal, to highlight what the box was for which would help with the user experience when it's clicked on. The following is the code I added, and below is the final result of the content:
